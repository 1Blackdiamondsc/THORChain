# THORChain

THORChain is a lightning fast decentralised exchange protocol. Read the whitepaper here: [THORChain Whitepaper](https://github.com/thorchain/Resources/tree/master/Whitepapers/THORChain)

This project is based on work done for the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) by the Cosmos/Tendermint team. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

* Install Go and set GOPATH: [https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Thorchain can be installed to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/thorchain/THORChain` like a normal Go program:

```sh
go get github.com/thorchain/THORChain
```

Then install dependencies:

```sh
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/thorchain/THORChain
make get_tools
make get_vendor_deps
make install
```

Verify that everything worked by running:

```sh
thorchaind version
```

and:

```sh
thorchaincli version
```

## Running the tests

```sh
make test
```

### Break down into end to end tests

```sh
